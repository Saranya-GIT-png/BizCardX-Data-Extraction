# BizCardX-Data-Extraction

BizCardX is a user-friendly tool for extracting information from business cards using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. This project leverages the EasyOCR library to recognize text on business cards and extracts the data into a SQL database after classification using regular expressions. The extracted information is then accessible through a GUI built using Streamlit. The BizCardX application provides an intuitive interface for users to upload business card images, extract information, and manage the data within a database.
